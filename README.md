# Basic-Sentiment-Analyzer

Using langchain and OpenAI's llm I have created a sentiment analyzer on a small dataset of customer reviews sourced from kaggle. The code is then deplyed locally using streamlit.
The code uses TextBlob to give a polarity score between -1 and 1 when a query is entered on the streamlit app.

Note : For this code to work you need to generate your own API key.
